I'm currently working in the Office of the CEO at GitHub.

Most recently, I've invented a new, cloud-native, easy-to-use version control system, called [Grace](https://github.com/scottarbeit/grace).

I've been a programmer since age 11, starting with the Apple ][+, AppleSoft BASIC, and 6502 Assembler. Since then, I've learned and mostly forgotten tons of other languages, operating systems, and software, all of which has happened during a long career where I've been a programmer, network administrator, DBA, consultant, architect, program manager, and product manager.

My most current resume, with a long list of stuff I know (and stuff I used to know) is [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmUyQqSnBAory7xCfzgOHZjZlwvyrQ?e=0DbFc6), if you're curious.

Lately, I've been exploring the mathematical and functional end of programming, learning some Category Theory and writing code using F#. I specialize in Microsoft Azure architecture and .NET programming, using CQRS and Event Sourcing whenever I can (but I'm sure your tech stack is cool, too).
