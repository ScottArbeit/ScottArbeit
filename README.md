### Grace Version Control System
I've invented a new, cloud-native, easy-to-use version control system, called [Grace](https://github.com/scottarbeit/grace), and you should totally [check it out](https://github.com/scottarbeit/grace). ❤️

### About me
I've been a programmer since age 11, starting with the Apple ][+, AppleSoft BASIC, and 6502 Assembler. Since then, I've learned and mostly forgotten tons of other languages, operating systems, and server and client software, during a long career in which I've been a programmer, network administrator, DBA, consultant, architect, Program Manager, and Product Manager.

My most current resume, with a long list of stuff I know (and stuff I used to know) and stuff I've done is [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmUyQqSnBAory7xCfzgOHZjZlwvyrQ?e=0DbFc6).

After 18 years of object-oriented programming (C++, VB.NET, and C#), around 2016 I started to explore the mathematical and functional end of programming. I learned some [Category Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) and even some [Category Theory II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmElia1eCEZNvsVscFef9m0dm) (for free on YouTube from a [great teacher](https://bartoszmilewski.com/), the world is amazing) and what a monad is, and now I write code mostly in F#. F# is just _fun_. It has a beautiful, minimal syntax, a full library of functional constructs **plus** access to the entire .NET ecosystem, it's strongly-typed, and it's _very_ fast.

The journey from object-oriented(-ish) thinking to functional(-ish) thinking can take time - think months, not weeks - but I'd like to report from the other side of that journey: it's worth it, both for quality and for developer ergomonics. _Loved it, would recommend._

I wish I could be good at All The Things, but there's just too many of them, so I specialize in cloud architecture using Microsoft Azure, and programming in .NET. I 💛 PaaS, virtual actors, CQRS and Event Sourcing.

Hi from a little bit east of Seattle. ☁️

Don't forget to check out [Grace](https://github.com/scottarbeit/grace). 😉

Lucky to have a great girlfriend, a great family, and more friends than I know what to do with.
